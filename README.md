## Project Goal
This project places me in the role of a data analyst at the Superstore company, wherein a dashboard has been requested, which provideds insights divided into 2 main categories.

### 1. Shipping Mode Analysis
The management team in the shipping department wants to review the performance of the different ship modes that the company provides to its customers.
- They need to know how many orders are shipped **on-time**, **early**, and **late**.
- They also need a visual that displays the number of shipments over a year for each ship status (i.e., on-time, early, and late) with the ability to filter on the following dimensions: **Region**, **Ship Mode**, **Year** and **Quarter**.

### 2. Customer Analysis
- The sales team wants to review the company's profit over sales as well as a **ranking of the customers** (from greatest to least) based on their total sales amount.
- The team needs the visuals to highlight information about a customer's profit ratio and to allow them to input the number N for a filter of **top customers based on total amount of sales**.
- The team also needs to be able to filter on the following dimensions: **Year**, **Region**, **Segment**, **Category**, **Subcategory**.
